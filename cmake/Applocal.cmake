# This script recursively searches for runtime dependencies of the given <input_file> and already found DLLs,
# and puts them in the directory occupied by the <input_file>. It accepts a list of <search_path> in form of multiple
# arguments or ';' separated list(s).

# Known bugs: Can't update DLLs. If DLLs already present in output dir, `file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES ...)` will find
# EXACTLY those DLLs ignoring additional search paths.
